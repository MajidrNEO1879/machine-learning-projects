    "NIFTY 500 is India’s first broad-based stock market index of the Indian stock market. It contains the top 500 listed companies on the NSE. The NIFTY 500 index represents about 96.1% of free-float market capitalization and 96.5% of the total turnover on the National Stock Exchange (NSE).\n",
    "\n",
    "NIFTY 500 companies are disaggregated into 72 industry indices. Industry weights in the index reflect industry weights in the market. For example, if the banking sector has a 5% weight in the universe of stocks traded on the NSE, banking stocks in the index would also have an approximate representation of 5% in the index. NIFTY 500 can be used for a variety of purposes such as benchmarking fund portfolios, launching index funds, ETFs, and other structured products.\n",

    "Dataset Glossary (Column-Wise)\n",
    "\n",
    "Company Name: Name of the Company.\n",
    "\n",
    "Symbol: A stock symbol is a unique series of letters assigned to a security for trading purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Industry: Name of the industry to which the stock belongs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Series: EQ stands for Equity. In this series intraday trading is possible in addition to delivery and BE stands for Book Entry. Shares falling in the Trade-to-Trade or T-segment are traded in this series and no intraday is allowed. This means trades can only be settled by accepting or giving the delivery of shares.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open: It is the price at which the financial security opens in the market when trading begins. It may or may not be different from the previous day's closing price. The security may open at a higher price than the closing price due to excess demand for the security.\n",
    "\n",
    "High: It is the highest price at which a stock is traded during the course of the trading day and is typically higher than the closing or equal to the opening price.\n",
    "\n",
    "Low: Today's low is a security's intraday low trading price. Today's low is the lowest price at which a stock trades over the course of a trading day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previous Close: The previous close almost always refers to the prior day's final price of a security when the market officially closes for the day. It can apply to a stock, bond, commodity, futures or option co-contract, market index, or any other security.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last Traded Price: The last traded price (LTP) usually differs from the closing price of the day. This is because the closing price of the day on NSE is the weighted average price of the last 30 mins of trading. The last traded price of the day is the actual last traded price.\n",
    "\n",
    "Change: For a stock or bond quote, change is the difference between the current price and the last trade of the previous day. For interest rates, change is benchmarked against a major market rate (e.g., LIBOR) and may only be updated as infrequently as once a quarter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Percentage Change: Take the selling price and subtract the initial purchase price. The result is the gain or loss. Take the gain or loss from the investment and divide it by the original amount or purchase price of the investment. Finally, multiply the result by 100 to arrive at the percentage change in the investment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Share Volume: Volume is an indicator that means the total number of shares that have been bought or sold in a specific period of time or during the trading day. It will also involve the buying and selling of every share during a specific time period.\n",
    "\n",
    "Value (Indian Rupee): Market value—also known as market cap—is calculated by multiplying a company's outstanding shares by its current market price.\n",
    "\n",
    "52-Week High: A 52-week high is the highest share price that a stock has traded at during a passing year. Many market aficionados view the 52-week high as an important factor in determining a stock's current value and predicting future price movement. 52-week High prices are adjusted for Bonus, Split & Rights Corporate actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "52-Week Low: A 52-week low is the lowest share price that a stock has traded at during a passing year. Many market aficionados view the 52-week low as an important factor in determining a stock's current value and predicting future price movement. 52-week low prices are adjusted for Bonus, Split & Rights Corporate actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "365 Day Percentage Change: Percent change is calculated with respect to adjusted price on ex-date for Corporate Actions like Dividend, Bonus, Rights & Face Value Split and also adjusted for Past Dividend, Bonus, Rights & Face Value Split and also adjusted for Past 365 days.\n",
    "\n",

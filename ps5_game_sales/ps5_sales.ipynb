    "This dataset combines information from VGChartz (sales data) and the RAWG API (game metadata) to provide an integrated view of the best-selling PlayStation games across three generations: PS3, PS4, and PS5.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sales data were collected from VGChartz as of October 2025, so PS5 sales figures are limited due to the recency of the platform. For PS3 and PS4, Sales quantities are updated to around the end of 2020.\n",
    "The goal is to make it easier for researchers, analysts, and gaming enthusiasts to explore how genres, platforms, and release years relate to sales performance over time."
